# webScraper

## Introduction
This webScraper is an introductory webScraper project that gathers share information from 
[Fortune 500 companies](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/components/s&p_500?p=1) and exports the data into a folder of csv files.

## Features
The webScraper is currently a precursor to machine learning models that learn from csv datasets. It can currently only scrape info from [this site](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/components/s&p_500?p=1).
Csv files will not be recreated if they already exist, and the files are stored in the users //User/Documents/Shared_Data directory.
